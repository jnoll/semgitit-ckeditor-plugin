# (h1) Level 1 Heading

Line one.
Line two.
Line three.

## (h2) Level 2 Heading with _emphasized text_

(h1) Level 1 Heading (alt syntax)
=================================

(h2) Level 2 Heading (alt syntax)
---------------------------------

Line with hard newline.  
This text starts a new line.
Another line with hard newline.\
This text also starts  a new line.

> (pre) This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.

> (pre)  This is also a (lazy) block quote. This
paragraph has two lines.

> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
2. Second item.

> This is a block quote.
>
> > A block quote within a block quote.

    (pre) indented code block
    if (a > 3) {
      moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
    }


~~~~~~~
(pre) fenced code block
if (a > 3) {
  moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
}
~~~~~~~

``` {.haskell}
(pre) fenced code block with language specifier (.haskell)
qsort [] = []
```

* itemized
* list
* last item

* itemized

* list with 

* blank lines


A list item may contain multiple paragraphs and other block-level content. 

  * First paragraph.

    Continued.

  * Second paragraph. With a code block, which must be indented
    eight spaces:

        { code }

List items may include other lists. In this case the preceding blank
line is optional. The nested list must be indented four spaces or one
tab:

* fruits
    + apples
        - macintosh
        - red delicious
    + pears
    + peaches
* vegetables
    + brocolli
    + chard

As noted above, markdown allows you to write list items “lazily,” instead of indenting continuation lines. 

+ A lazy, lazy, list
item.

+ Another one; this looks
bad but is legal.

    Second paragraph of second
list item.


## (h2) Ordered Lists ##

1.  one
2.  two
3.  three

The following yields a list with numbers followed by a single
parenthesis, starting with 9, and a sublist with lowercase roman
numerals:

 9)  Ninth
10)  Tenth
11)  Eleventh
       i. subone
      ii. subtwo
     iii. subthree

So, the following will create three lists:

(2) Two
(5) Three
1.  Four
*   Five

If default list markers are desired, use #.:

#.  one
#.  two
#.  three

## (h2) Definition lists


Term 1

:   Definition 1

Term 2 with *inline markup*

:   Definition 2

        { some code, part of Definition 2 }

    Third paragraph of definition 2.

Compact form.

Term 1
  ~ Definition 1
Term 2
  ~ Definition 2a
  ~ Definition 2b

## (h2) Numbered example lists


(@)  My first example will be numbered (1).
(@)  My second example will be numbered (2).

Explanation of examples.

(@)  My third example will be numbered (3).

Numbered examples can be labeled and referred to elsewhere in the document:

(@good)  This is a good example.

As (@good) illustrates, ...

Pandoc transforms this into a “compact list” (with no <p> tags around
“First”, “Second”, or “Third”):

+   First
+   Second:
    -   Fee
    -   Fie
    -   Foe

+   Third

To “cut off” the list after item two, you can insert some non-indented
content, like an HTML comment, which won’t produce visible output in
any format:

-   item one
-   item two

<!-- end of list -->

    { my code block }

You can use the same trick if you want two consecutive lists instead
of one big list:


1.  one
2.  two
3.  three

<!-- -->

1.  uno
2.  dos
3.  tres

# (h1) Tables!

Simple tables look like this:

  Right     Left     Center     Default
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1

Table:  (caption) Demonstration of simple table syntax.

The column headers may be omitted, provided a dashed line is used to
end the table. For example: 

-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12             12
    123     123       123           123
      1     1          1              1
-------     ------ ----------   -------

Table: (caption) No column headers.

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Centered   Default           Right Left
  Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
   First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    the blank line between
                                    rows.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Here's the caption. It, too, may span
multiple lines.

                                    rows.
-------------------------------------------------------------

: (caption) Here's a multiline table without headers.


### (h3) Grid tables 

Look like this:

: Sample grid table.

+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Fruit         | Price         | Advantages         |
+===============+===============+====================+
| Bananas       | $1.34         | - built-in wrapper |
|               |               | - bright color     |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Oranges       | $2.10         | - cures scurvy     |
|               |               | - tasty            |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+

## (h2) Inline markup

**bold**

__also bold__

_italic_

*also italic*

~~strikeout~~

*\*backslash escaped\**

text^superscript, as in 2^10 is 1024.

text~subscript, as in H~2~O is water.

Inline `verbatim text` rest of sentence.

This `verbatim text`{.haskell} has a haskell class attribute.


## (h2) Raw HTML

with embedded markdown:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>*emphasized*</td>
        <td>[a link](http://google.com)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## (h2) Raw LaTeX

This sentence has a citation \cite{citation-needed}.


Here is a latex table:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
Age & Frequency \\ \hline
18--25  & 15 \\
26--35  & 33 \\ 
36--45  & 22 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Here is some latex math inline: $\tuple{a, b, c}$.

## (h2) Links

Automatic links:

<http://google.com>
<sam@green.eggs.ham>

 
This is an [inline link](/url), and here's [one with
a title](http://fsf.org "click here for a good time!").

### (h3) Reference links

Here are some examples:

[my label 1]: /foo/bar.html  "My title, optional"
[my label 2]: /foo
[my label 3]: http://fsf.org (The free software foundation)
[my label 4]: /bar#special  'A title in single quotes'

The URL may optionally be surrounded by angle brackets:

[my label 5]: <http://foo.bar.baz>

The title may go on the next line:

[my label 3]: http://fsf.org
  "The free software foundation"

Note that link labels are not case sensitive. So, this will work:

Here is [my link][FOO]

[Foo]: /bar/baz

In an implicit reference link, the second pair of brackets is empty, or omitted entirely:

See [my website][], or [my website].

[my website]: http://foo.bar.baz


## (h2) Images

![la lune](lalune.jpg "Voyage to the moon")

![movie reel]

[movie reel]: movie.gif

![This is the caption of a figure](/url/of/image.png)

![This image won't be a figure](/url/of/image.png)\ 

## (h2) Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they 
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]

## (h2) Citations

Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].

Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].

Smith says blah [-@smith04], cited without name.


You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

@smith04 says blah.

@smith04 [p. 33] says blah.
